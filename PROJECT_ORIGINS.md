## Database Schema (Original)

```sql
-- Users table
CREATE TABLE users (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  username TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  password_hash TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Tickets table
CREATE TABLE tickets (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  priority TEXT DEFAULT 'medium',
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'open',
  created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  due_date DATE,
  assigned_to INTEGER,
  created_by INTEGER NOT NULL,
  FOREIGN KEY (assigned_to) REFERENCES users (id),
  FOREIGN KEY (created_by) REFERENCES users (id)
);

-- Notes table
CREATE TABLE notes (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  ticket_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
  content TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  created_by INTEGER NOT NULL,
  FOREIGN KEY (ticket_id) REFERENCES tickets (id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (created_by) REFERENCES users (id)
);
```

## Original Design Philosophy

### 1. **Freshdesk-Inspired But Simplified**
- Borrowed the core concept of ticket-based task management
- Removed complex features like automation, SLAs, and advanced reporting
- Focused on essential workflow: Create → Assign → Track → Resolve

### 2. **Small Team Optimization**
- Designed for teams of 5-20 people
- Simple role system (no complex permissions)
- Basic but effective collaboration through notes
- Easy deployment without complex infrastructure

### 3. **Task-Centric Approach**
- Optimized for internal task tracking rather than customer support
- Simple priority and status system
- Focus on getting things done rather than complex workflows

## Success Metrics (Original Goals)

### Achieved:
✅ **Easy Setup**: Single command deployment with SQLite  
✅ **Intuitive Interface**: Clean, simple UI that requires no training  
✅ **Fast Performance**: Lightweight and responsive  
✅ **Essential Features**: All core ticket management functionality  
✅ **Professional Appearance**: Clean, modern design  

### Original Scope:
- **Small Team Ready**: Perfect for teams managing daily tasks
- **No Bloat**: Only essential features included
- **Quick Deployment**: Easy to get running in minutes
- **Maintenance-Free**: Minimal ongoing administration needed
